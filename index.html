            It's been almost 20 years since the release of the library that in
            many ways popularised JavaScript and turned it into what it is
            today. A few years later, we started seeing frameworks pop up, and a
            new era of the frontend began. 7 years after the launch of jQuery,
            Facebook open sourced React.js, and its component based approach
            sent a large part of the existing frontend JavaScript frameworks and
            the web platform itself spinning. Eventually other frameworks like
            Svelte came along, alongside React meta frameworks like Next.js. One
            thing they all have in common are heavy build pipelines, and not
            running the same code you wrote anywhere. Not on the server and
            certainly not on the client.

            So where are we today? While all these new JavaScript frameworks
            popped up, the web platform has become really, really good! The
            JavaScript frameworks that were considered "modern" 10 years ago are
            still being used, but are definitely not modern anymore. Some of
            them are even go out of their way to *not* use the platform's native
            features. Want to submit a newsletter signup form with one field and
            a button? Hook up this extremely heavy library for managing form
            state, but don't use the native browser events, use a synthetic
            event model is a remnant from when IE6 had a messed up event model,
            and make sure everything is sent as JSON all the time. But there's

          <aside class="notes">
            HTML is the ultimate declarative language for describing content and
            structure. The browsers makes sure they're forgiving to your
            mistakes, and they do a *really* good job. You can even include
            elements that the browser doesn't know about, and expand them into
            functional elements using custom elements. It's also the language
            that drives everything else on the web, so browsers are incredibly
            fast at parsing and rendering the HTML that is downloaded from a
            server somewhere. A lot of HTML elements have also gotten very good
            at declaratively defining behavior. Just think of form controls,
