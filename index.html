            This past decade+ we've seen frontend frameworks come and go. We've

              Let's look at a brief history of clientside libraries and
              frameworks
            </p>
            <p>
              It's been almost 20 years since the release of the library that in
              many ways popularised JavaScript and turned it into what it is
              today. A few years later, we started seeing frameworks pop up, and
              a new era of the frontend began.
            </p>
            <p>
              7 years after the launch of jQuery, Facebook open sourced
              React.js, and its component based approach sent a large part of
              the existing frontend JavaScript frameworks and the web platform
              itself spinning. Eventually other frameworks like Svelte came
              along, alongside React meta frameworks like Next.js.
            </p>
            <p>
              One thing they all have in common are heavy build pipelines, and
              not running the same code you wrote anywhere. Not on the server
              and certainly not on the client.

              So where are we today? While all these new JavaScript frameworks
              popped up, the web platform has become really, really good!
            </p>
            <p>
              The JavaScript frameworks that were considered "modern" 10 years
              ago are still being used heavily, but are definitely not that
              modern anymore. They're still doing a lot of work that they need
              to do in order to
            </p>
            <p>
              Some of them are even go out of their way to *not* use the
              platform's native features. Want to submit a newsletter signup
              form with one field and a button? Hook up this extremely heavy
              library for managing form state, but don't use the native browser
              events, use a synthetic event model is a remnant from when IE6 had
              a messed up event model, and make sure everything is sent as JSON
              all the time. But there's

            <p>
              HTML is the ultimate declarative language for describing content
              and structure. The browsers makes sure they're forgiving to your
              mistakes, and they do a *really* good job.
            </p>
            <p>You get all the buzzword for free!</p>
            <p>
              You can even include elements that the browser doesn't know about,
              and expand them into functional elements using custom elements.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's also the language that drives everything else on the web, so
              browsers are incredibly fast at parsing and rendering the HTML
              that is downloaded from a server somewhere. A lot of HTML elements
              have also gotten very good at declaratively defining behavior.
              Just think about how easy it is to build basic clientside form
              validation for instance? Unless you need to do some custom stuff,
              you can get far by simply utilizing HTML.
            </p>

            <p>
              CSS has always been a powerful language, but in recent years it
              has gained serious super powers!
            </p>
            <p>
              Combining the newer declarative behaviors available in HTML with
              the new CSS super powers, we can do some really cool stuff with
              very little code!
            </p>

              Tailwind is great, but that doesn't mean it should be used *for
              everything*

              Maybe. Browser support isn't great for everything you've seen
              today. The whole presentation has run in Chrome Canary just to
              make sure it would all work. That doesn't mean it won't get there
              at some point though.

              I'll leave that up to you. There's still going to be benefits to
              using some type of framework, but maybe we should ask ourselves if
              it's really necessary to start with a given framework in 2025, or
              if we can solve a lot of the problems we have simply by using the
              native web platform that we have.
